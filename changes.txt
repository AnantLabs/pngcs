===========  HISTORY PngCs  http://code.google.com/p/pngcs/ ================

14/Aug/2012:  1.0.95
  - Defensive limits and related tuning in PngReader 
   -- Added: MaxTotalBytesRead (200MB), MaxBytesMetadata (5MB), SkipChunkMaxSize (2MB) SkipChunkIds ( "fdAT" )
   -- PngChunkSkipped : now skipped chunks are really skipped (never loaded in memory)  All skipped chunks end in ChunksLists as a PngChunkSkipped
   -- Several related polishing in PngReader (ParseChunkAndAddToList() removed, ReadChunk() added)
	 -- 'offset' added in chunks (mainly informational)
	 -- 'offset' in PngReader: now a long (to support greater than 2GB files), updated and checked against MaxTotalBytesRead

23/Jun/2012:  1.0.93
  - PngReader.GetRow() allows non sequential reading  (useful for skipping lines)
  - PngReader.End() is no longer deprecated but recommended (related to the previous)
  - ImageLine.Pack()/ ImageLine.Unpack() was requiring/returning a buffer of length greater than cols*nchannels - fixed
  - Added PngWriter.ComputeCompressionRatio()
  
15/Jun/2012:  1.0.92
  - LICENCE change: now released under Apache License
  - Replaced #ZipLib code for standalone assembly : ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
  - General polishing, to better fit C# conventions and good practices. 
  Quite a bit of changes in signatures (cases, specially), break backward compatibility.
  - Trimmed unnecesary imports (Linq) and replace unnecesary dependendance on .Net 4.0. Now the target is .Net 2.0
  - Documented all classes/methods (Pngcs.xml)
  - Reorganized and added some sample projects (SampleCreateOrangeGradient) 
  - Added Doxygen documentation

10/June/2012: 1.0.91
  - Major reorganization to put in sync with Java port: updated to PngJ v 0.91, with all Chunks and full PNGTestSuite
  - Most public methods/properties naming complies with C# conventions now

22/Sept/2011: Implemented functionality is on par with current PngJ, 
some testing, optimizing and testing pending.

21/Sept/2011: Added classes from SharpZipLib, basic reading and writing works

Jan/2011: Basic port, aided by http://j2cstranslator.sourceforge.net/ (nice tool!)

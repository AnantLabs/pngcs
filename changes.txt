15/Jun/2012:  1.0.92
  - LICENCE change: now released under Apache License
  - Replaced #ZipLib code for standalone assembly : ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
  - General polishing, to better fit C# conventions and good practices. 
  Quite a bit of changes in signatures (cases, specially), break backward compatibility.
  - Trimmed unnecesary imports (Linq) and replace unnecesary dependendance on .Net 4.0. Now the target is .Net 2.0
  - Documented all classes/methods (Pngcs.xml)
  - Reorganized and added some sample projects (SampleCreateOrangeGradient) 
  - Added Doxygen documentation

10/June/2012: 1.0.91
  - Major reorganization to put in sync with Java port: updated to PngJ v 0.91, with all Chunks and full PNGTestSuite
  - Most public methods/properties naming complies with C# conventions now

22/Sept/2011: Implemented functionality is on par with current PngJ, 
some testing, optimizing and testing pending.

21/Sept/2011: Added classes from SharpZipLib, basic reading and writing works

Jan/2011: Basic port, aided by http://j2cstranslator.sourceforge.net/ (nice tool!)
